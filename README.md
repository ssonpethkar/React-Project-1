props and state 
parent and child communication

state => manages javascript
UI => DOM


framework vs library

### points
1. core react (State , UI manioulation, JSX)
2. Component reusability
3. reusing of components (props)
4. how to propogate change(hooks)
 
## adv
1. Router ( react don't have router)
2. State management( react don't have state management) -> relax, redux,toolkit,zustand,context API
3. class based component
    legacy code 
4. BAAS APPS
    social media clone, e-commerce app,...
